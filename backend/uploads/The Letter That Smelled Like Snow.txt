The Letter That Smelled Like Snow

Years later, Kusum worked in a travel office near Thamel, surrounded by posters of places that looked like miracles—Ladakh, Annapurna, Everest Base Camp. Tourists came in with bright jackets and brighter questions, asking how hard the trek was, how cold, how dangerous, how “worth it.”

Kusum answered politely, always. She knew the numbers. She knew the routes. She knew the stories other people wanted: struggle, triumph, panoramic photos.

But she never told them what she knew in her bones—that the Himalaya didn’t belong to anyone’s story. People belonged to it.

One afternoon, when the city was soft with monsoon humidity and scooters hissed through puddles, a letter arrived. Not an email. Not a printed itinerary. A letter, folded neatly and tied with string.

The handwriting was familiar in a way that made her throat tighten.

Dorje Sherpa.

Her father’s name.

Except her father had been gone for three years, claimed not by Everest but by an ordinary fever that arrived in a small village with no drama at all.

Kusum stared at the envelope as if it might breathe. Her hands trembled when she opened it.

Inside was a note, short and precise:

Kusum,
I promised your father I would bring you to the place he loved most, if you ever wanted.
If you do, meet me in Lukla on the 8th.
—Dorje

No explanation. No sentiment. Just an invitation that felt like a door cracking open.

Kusum folded the letter and held it to her face. It smelled like paper and dust and something colder—like snow remembered through distance.

That night she didn’t sleep. She watched the ceiling fan spin, and the shadows it cast looked like prayer flags in slow motion.

By morning, she had packed a small bag. Not because she was certain, but because she was tired of living in “maybe.”
